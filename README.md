# Product Recommendation System for E-commerce

### Product Recommendation System for E-commerce
To increase the basket size and average order value for customers who only have 1 item in the cart.

### Summary

Customers keep spending hours scrolling through thousands of items, struggling to find an item they want and they will end out losing interest and buying only a single item. Customers need to be provided suggestions based on their interests in order to create a better shopping environment that stimulates demand and boosts sales.

This project will demonstrate a solution to this problem - a cross-selling complementary recommendation system!

The system will filter the data based on the past purchase behaviour of the customer. Through an algorithm, it will predict and recommend the most relevant items to the customer based on items that are frequently purchased together. For instance, if someone buys a computer, the system will recommend a keyboard or a mouse and when someone buys a smartphone, the system will recommend headphone or a casing for that model.

Itâ€™s a great way to reveal products that the customer might otherwise not discover and it makes it a lot easier for the shopper. This leads to a great shopping experience and also a great way to increase product exposure and sales opportunity.
